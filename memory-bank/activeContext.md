# Active Context: Merger Game

## Current Work Focus

Overhauling the UI, adding a Map Screen, and refining the Game Grid Screen based on visual references. Implementing a new emoji-based merge sequence.

## Recent Changes

*   **Persistence:**
    *   Implemented local data persistence using Isar.
    *   `GameService` handles loading and saving game state (grid, player stats, orders, unlocked zones).
    *   `TileData`, `PlayerStats`, and `Order` models are now Isar collections.
    *   A debug "Save Game" button has been added to the UI.
*   **XP + Leveling System:**
    *   XP thresholds per level are defined.
    *   XP is awarded for completing orders and merging items.
    *   `PlayerStatsNotifier` automatically triggers `levelUp` when enough XP is gained.
    *   `levelUp` increases the player level, resets XP, refills energy, and increases `maxEnergy`.
*   **Order System:**
    *   The `currentCount` field was removed from the `Order` model.
    *   The `OrderNotifier` now checks the grid directly for item counts.
*   **Zone Unlocking:**
    *   The `unlockedStatusProvider` now derives its state from `playerStatsProvider`.
    *   The `unlockZone` method in `PlayerStatsNotifier` directly modifies the `unlockedZoneIds` list within the `PlayerStats` state.
    *   The `_initializeGridData` method in `GridNotifier` now creates `TileType.locked` tiles based on the zones defined in `expansion_provider` that are *not* initially unlocked.
    *   The `_unlockTilesForZone` method in `GridNotifier` updates the types/images of tiles within that zone.
*   **Map Screen:**
    *   Created `lib/screens/map_screen.dart`.
    *   Added a top status bar (Level, Energy, Coins, Gems) similar to the reference image.
    *   Included a placeholder for the main map content area.
*   **Game Grid Screen (`lib/widgets/game_grid_screen.dart`):**
    *   Removed the default `AppBar`.
    *   Added the same custom top status bar as the Map Screen.
    *   Implemented a brown/light-brown chessboard background for grid tiles.
    *   Removed the visual number display (`overlayNumber`) from items.
    *   Adjusted tile sizing slightly.
    *   Added placeholder elements (e.g., bottom info bar).
*   **Merging & Items:**
    *   Introduced a new plant-based emoji merge sequence (`üå±` -> `üåø` -> `üå≥` ...) in `lib/providers/grid_provider.dart`.
    *   Removed the previous number-based merging logic and associated XP gains.
    *   Added XP gains based on the plant merge level.
    *   Updated the Barracks generator to spawn the base plant item (`üå±`).
*   **Player Stats:**
    *   Added a `gems` field to the `PlayerStats` model (`lib/models/player_stats.dart`).
    *   Updated `PlayerStatsNotifier` (`lib/providers/player_provider.dart`) to manage the `gems` state.
    *   Ran `build_runner` to update generated files.
*   **Screen Navigation:**
    *   Implemented a `StateProvider` (`lib/providers/navigation_provider.dart`) to manage the active screen index.
    *   Added a `FloatingActionButton` to both `GameGridScreen` and `MapScreen` to toggle between the screens.
    *   Modified `lib/main.dart` to use the `activeScreenIndexProvider` to display the correct screen.
*   **New Merge Sequence (Tools):**
    *   Added a new "Tool" merge sequence (`üîß` -> `üî®` -> `üî©` -> `‚öôÔ∏è` -> `üîó`) in `lib/providers/grid_provider.dart`.
    *   Added corresponding merge logic and XP rewards in `GridNotifier.mergeTiles`.
    *   Added a new "Workshop" generator (`üè≠`) definition and placement logic (`placeGenerator`) in `lib/providers/grid_provider.dart` to spawn the base tool (`üîß`).
*   **Game Grid Screen UI Overhaul (`lib/widgets/game_grid_screen.dart`):**
    *   Replaced the top status bar (`_buildTopArea`, `_buildResourceBar`) with a new HUD layout using placeholder emojis/icons (`üë§`, `ü™ô`).
    *   Replaced the order display (`_buildOrderDisplay`) with a new layout showing only the first order, using placeholder emojis (`üßë`).
    *   Replaced the bottom info bar placeholder (`_buildBottomInfoBarPlaceholder`) with a new layout (`_buildBottomInfoBar`) using placeholder emojis (`‚ÑπÔ∏è`).
    *   Added subtle drop shadows to item tiles in `_buildTile`.
    *   Removed the placeholder star background concept (`‚≠ê`) from behind item tiles in `_buildTile`.
    *   Adjusted the visual tile size in the `_buildTile` method (reduced SizedBox dimensions).
    *   Modified the `Draggable` feedback and childWhenDragging to only show the item being dragged, leaving the base tile static.
*   **Grid Dimensions:**
    *   Changed grid size constants (`rowCount`, `colCount`) in `lib/providers/grid_provider.dart` from 11x6 to 9x7.

## Next Steps

*   **Map Screen Implementation:** Replace the placeholder in `MapScreen` with actual map graphics, navigation, and potentially zone previews/interactions. Update its Top HUD.
*   **Grid UI Refinement:**
    *   Replace placeholder emojis/icons in the Top HUD, Order Display, and Bottom Info Bar with actual assets or final icons.
    *   Implement dynamic text updates for the Bottom Info Bar based on selected tile.
    *   Implement energy cooldown display in the Top HUD.
    *   Further adjust grid layout for the new 9x7 dimensions if needed.
*   **Refactor Shared UI:** Extract the new Top HUD code (`_buildTopArea`, `_buildTopResource`) into a shared widget used by both `GameGridScreen` and `MapScreen`.
*   **Content Expansion:**
    *   Add the new Workshop generator (`üè≠`) to the initial grid setup or make it unlockable.
    *   Add more merge chains, generators, orders (using new items), and unlockable zones/map areas, considering the new 9x7 grid size.
*   **Balancing:** Fine-tune XP, costs, rewards, and unlock requirements for both merge sequences, considering the new 9x7 grid size.
*   **Testing:** Implement automated tests.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

*   **Shared UI Components:** The new Top HUD logic is currently only in `GameGridScreen` and needs to be added to `MapScreen` and potentially refactored.
*   **Placeholders:** The UI currently uses placeholder emojis/icons and static text in some areas (Bottom Info Bar).
*   **Data Modeling:** (Existing consideration) Evaluate grid state storage efficiency.
*   **Save Frequency:** (Existing consideration) Determine optimal save frequency.
*   **Error Handling:** (Existing consideration) Improve Isar error handling.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

*   Use Riverpod for all state management.
*   Use Isar for local persistence.
*   Keep models immutable where possible.
*   Use asynchronous operations for I/O.

## Learnings and Project Insights

*   Isar is relatively easy to integrate and use for local persistence.
*   Riverpod's provider pattern simplifies state management and UI updates.
*   Careful data modeling is crucial for efficient persistence and retrieval.
*   Updating Isar models requires running `build_runner`.
*   Clear visual references are essential for UI tasks.
