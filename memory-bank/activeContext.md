# Active Context: Merger Game

## Current Work Focus

Overhauling the UI, adding a Map Screen, and refining the Game Grid Screen based on visual references. Implementing a new emoji-based merge sequence.

## Recent Changes

*   **Persistence:**
    *   Implemented local data persistence using Isar.
    *   `GameService` handles loading and saving game state (grid, player stats, orders, unlocked zones).
    *   `TileData`, `PlayerStats`, and `Order` models are now Isar collections.
    *   A debug "Save Game" button has been added to the UI.
*   **XP + Leveling System:**
    *   XP thresholds per level are defined.
    *   XP is awarded for completing orders and merging items.
    *   `PlayerStatsNotifier` automatically triggers `levelUp` when enough XP is gained.
    *   `levelUp` increases the player level, resets XP, refills energy, and increases `maxEnergy`.
*   **Order System:**
    *   The `currentCount` field was removed from the `Order` model.
    *   The `OrderNotifier` now checks the grid directly for item counts.
*   **Zone Unlocking:**
    *   The `unlockedStatusProvider` now derives its state from `playerStatsProvider`.
    *   The `unlockZone` method in `PlayerStatsNotifier` directly modifies the `unlockedZoneIds` list within the `PlayerStats` state.
    *   The `_initializeGridData` method in `GridNotifier` now creates `TileType.locked` tiles based on the zones defined in `expansion_provider` that are *not* initially unlocked.
    *   The `_unlockTilesForZone` method in `GridNotifier` updates the types/images of tiles within that zone.
*   **Map Screen:**
    *   Created `lib/screens/map_screen.dart`.
    *   Added a top status bar (Level, Energy, Coins, Gems) similar to the reference image.
    *   Included a placeholder for the main map content area.
*   **Game Grid Screen (`lib/widgets/game_grid_screen.dart`):**
    *   Removed the default `AppBar`.
    *   Added the same custom top status bar as the Map Screen.
    *   Implemented a brown/light-brown chessboard background for grid tiles.
    *   Removed the visual number display (`overlayNumber`) from items.
    *   Adjusted tile sizing slightly.
    *   Added placeholder elements (e.g., bottom info bar).
*   **Merging & Items:**
    *   Introduced a new plant-based emoji merge sequence (`üå±` -> `üåø` -> `üå≥` ...) in `lib/providers/grid_provider.dart`.
    *   Removed the previous number-based merging logic and associated XP gains.
    *   Added XP gains based on the plant merge level.
    *   Updated the Barracks generator to spawn the base plant item (`üå±`).
*   **Player Stats:**
    *   Added a `gems` field to the `PlayerStats` model (`lib/models/player_stats.dart`).
    *   Updated `PlayerStatsNotifier` (`lib/providers/player_provider.dart`) to manage the `gems` state.
    *   Ran `build_runner` to update generated files.
*   **Screen Navigation:**
    *   Implemented a `StateProvider` (`lib/providers/navigation_provider.dart`) to manage the active screen index.
    *   Added a `FloatingActionButton` to both `GameGridScreen` and `MapScreen` to toggle between the screens.
    *   Modified `lib/main.dart` to use the `activeScreenIndexProvider` to display the correct screen.
*   **New Merge Sequence (Tools):**
    *   Added a new "Tool" merge sequence (`üîß` -> `üî®` -> `üî©` -> `‚öôÔ∏è` -> `üîó`) in `lib/providers/grid_provider.dart`.
    *   Added corresponding merge logic and XP rewards in `GridNotifier.mergeTiles`.
    *   Added a new "Workshop" generator (`üè≠`) definition and placement logic (`placeGenerator`) in `lib/providers/grid_provider.dart` to spawn the base tool (`üîß`).
*   **Game Grid Screen UI Overhaul (`lib/widgets/game_grid_screen.dart`):**
    *   Replaced the top status bar (`_buildTopArea`, `_buildResourceBar`) with a new HUD layout using placeholder emojis/icons (`üë§`, `ü™ô`).
    *   Replaced the order display (`_buildOrderDisplay`) with a new layout showing only the first order, using placeholder emojis (`üßë`).
    *   Replaced the bottom info bar placeholder (`_buildBottomInfoBarPlaceholder`) with a new layout (`_buildBottomInfoBar`) using placeholder emojis (`‚ÑπÔ∏è`).
    *   Added subtle drop shadows to item tiles in `_buildTile`.
    *   Removed the placeholder star background concept (`‚≠ê`) from behind item tiles in `_buildTile`.
    *   Adjusted the visual tile size in the `_buildTile` method (reduced SizedBox dimensions).
    *   Modified the `Draggable` feedback and childWhenDragging to only show the item being dragged, leaving the base tile static.
*   **Grid Dimensions:**
    *   Changed grid size constants (`rowCount`, `colCount`) in `lib/providers/grid_provider.dart` from 11x6 to 9x7.
*   **Progression Overhaul (Infrastructure-Based):**
    *   Leveling is now triggered by maxing out the infrastructure upgrades for the current player level (`maxInfrastructureUpgrade` in `player_provider.dart`).
    *   `PlayerStats` model tracks `infrastructureLevelsData`.
    *   `PlayerStatsNotifier` handles infrastructure-based leveling via `upgradeInfrastructure`, `_checkPlayerLevelUp`, and `levelUp`.
    *   XP is tracked but decoupled from leveling. Order completion grants rewards (coins, XP) but does not directly trigger level-ups.
    *   `OrderNotifier` generates orders based on player level (`_ordersByLevel`) but does *not* call any leveling methods in `PlayerStatsNotifier`.
*   **Initial Setup:**
    *   `GridNotifier` now places Camp (`üèïÔ∏è`), Mine (`‚õèÔ∏è`), and Workshop (`üè≠`) generators at fixed positions (4,1), (4,3), (4,5) during initialization.
    *   The manual spawn `FloatingActionButton` has been removed from `GameGridScreen`. Item generation relies on generators.
*   **Generator Config:** Added missing configuration for Mine (`‚õèÔ∏è`) in `lib/models/generator_config.dart`.
*   **Generator Activation:** Temporarily commented out the cooldown check (`isReady`) in `GridNotifier.activateGenerator`.
*   **Build Runner:** Executed successfully after `PlayerStats` model changes.


## Next Steps (Prioritized)

*   **Refactor Shared UI:** Extract the new Top HUD code (`_buildTopArea`, `_buildTopResource`) into a shared widget to be used by both `GameGridScreen` and `MapScreen`. This is a prerequisite for consistent UI across screens.
*   **Grid UI Refinement:**
    *   Replace placeholder emojis/icons in the Top HUD, Order Display, and Bottom Info Bar with actual assets or final icons.
    *   Implement dynamic text updates for the Bottom Info Bar based on selected tile (Needs polish).
    *   Implement energy cooldown display in the Top HUD.
    *   Further adjust grid layout for the new 9x7 dimensions if needed.
*   **Map Screen Implementation:**
    *   Integrate the shared Top HUD.
    *   Replace the placeholder in `MapScreen` with actual map graphics, navigation, and potentially zone previews/interactions.
*   **Content Expansion:**
    *   **Crucial:** Populate `mergeItemsByEmoji` map in `lib/models/merge_trees.dart` with definitions for all planned items.
    *   Add more merge chains, generators, and orders (using the newly defined items).
    *   Define and add more unlockable zones/map areas.
*   **Balancing:** Fine-tune order requirements, rewards, generator cooldowns/costs (cooldown currently disabled), and **infrastructure upgrade costs** for the progression system. Balance XP rewards if XP is kept for other purposes.
*   **Testing:** Implement automated tests, especially for the **infrastructure-based leveling**, order systems, and UI interactions. Re-enable and test generator cooldowns.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

*   **Shared UI Components:** The new Top HUD logic is currently only in `GameGridScreen` and needs to be added to `MapScreen` and potentially refactored.
*   **Placeholders:** The UI currently uses placeholder emojis/icons. Bottom Info Bar text is dynamic but needs polish.
*   **Leveling System:** The infrastructure-based leveling system needs balancing (upgrade costs vs. rewards). XP system is currently unused for leveling.
*   **Generator Cooldowns:** Currently disabled for testing/simplicity. Need to be re-enabled and balanced.
*   **Data Modeling:** (Existing consideration) Evaluate grid state storage efficiency.
*   **Save Frequency:** (Existing consideration) Determine optimal save frequency.
*   **Error Handling:** (Existing consideration) Improve Isar error handling.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

*   Use Riverpod for all state management.
*   Use Isar for local persistence.
*   Keep models immutable where possible.
*   Use asynchronous operations for I/O.
*   Leveling can be tied to different metrics (XP vs. Orders).

## Learnings and Project Insights

*   Isar is relatively easy to integrate and use for local persistence.
*   Riverpod's provider pattern simplifies state management and UI updates.
*   Careful data modeling is crucial for efficient persistence and retrieval.
*   Updating Isar models requires running `build_runner`.
*   Clear visual references are essential for UI tasks.
